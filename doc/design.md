# MeChat 0.1.0
We use C/S architecture to realize `MeChat`.
In this architecture, We have only one server which public ip is `server_ip`, 
and two client which public ips are `client_ip_1` and `client_ip_2` respectively.

## TODO list
[] client-to-server, client1 talk with server in simple
[] client-to-client, client1 talk with client2 in simple
